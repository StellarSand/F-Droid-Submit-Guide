## 1. App Metadata
The app's metadata should follow the `Fastlane` or `Triple-T structure`. I recommend using the `Fastlane` structure.

- Create `fastlane/metadata/android` directory in the root of your app directory.
   Example: `MyApp/fastlane/metadata/android`
- Within `fastlane/metadata/android` create `en-US` directory. This is required because English is the fallback language by F-Droid. Other languages are optional.
  <br>For other languages create respective directories like `de-DE`, `es-ES`, `fr-FR` etc.
- Within `en-US`, create >
    - `full_description.txt`: The full app description.
    - `short_description.txt`: A brief description (max 80 characters).
    - `title.txt`: The app name.
    - `changelogs` directory: Include changelogs named as `<versionCode>.txt` (max 500 characters).
        <br>Example: If `versionCode` is `100`, create `100.txt`
    - `images` directory: Within this, create >
        - `icon.png`: The app icon.
        - `featureGraphic.png`: Banner displayed on top (landscape).
        - `phoneScreenshots` directory: Include screenshots named as `1.png`, `2.png`, etc.

The directory structure should look like the following:
     
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A(MyApp/fastlane/metadata/android) --> B(en-US)
    B --> C([full_description.txt])
    B --> D([short_description.txt])
    B --> E([title.txt])
    B --> F(changelogs)
    B --> G(images)
    F --> H([100.txt])
    F --> I([102.txt])
    G --> J([icon.png])
    G --> K([featureGraphic.png])
    G --> L(phoneScreenshots)
    L --> M([1.png])
    L --> N([2.png])
```

For reference, check [this fastlane structure](https://github.com/StellarSand/IYPS/tree/main/fastlane/metadata/android).

You can read more about the app metadata [here](https://f-droid.org/docs/All_About_Descriptions_Graphics_and_Screenshots/).



## 2. Release a signed build of your app
- In Android Studio > Build > Generate signed APK
- Create a tagged release (let's say on GitHub) with the generated signed apk.



## 3. Build Metadata
- Create an account on [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com).
- Fork the [fdroiddata](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata) repo.
- Create a new branch named after your appâ€™s name or its package name.
- In the newly created branch, go to the `metadata` directory & create a new file named `<your app's package name>.yml`. Example: `com.myapp.yml`

You can read more about the build metadata [here](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Build_Metadata_Reference/).

Before proceeding further, decide whether you want reproducible builds or not.
<br>A benefit of reproducible builds is that users can upgrade to a new version of your app irrespective of where they previously installed it from. Example: Users can install the apk from GitHub and upgrade later to a newer version using F-Droid & vice-versa.

#### Reproducible builds
- Assuming that when creating a tagged release earlier, the tag was named with a `v` (example: `v1.0.0`) and the apk was named `MyApp_v1.0.0`.
- In the root directory of your app, open the `local.properties` file.
- Copy the `sdk.dir` value. Example: `/home/JohnDoe/Android-SDK`.
- Go to `/home/JohnDoe/Android-Sdk/build-tools/` & check the latest `build-tools` version installed. Example: `34.0.0`.
- Open a terminal.
- Navigate to the directory:
  ```bash
    cd /home/JohnDoe/Android-Sdk/build-tools/34.0.0
  ```
- Use `apksigner` to get the SHA-256 digest of your signing certificate:
  ```bash
    ./apksigner verify --print-certs /path/to/the/generated_signed_apk
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  ./apksigner verify --print-certs /home/JohnDoe/AndroidStudioProjects/MyApp/app/release/MyApp_v1.0.0-release.apk
  ```
- Copy the `Signer #1 certificate SHA-256 digest` value.
- Type the metadata in the build metadata file created earlier (`com.myapp.yml`).
